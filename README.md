Quantity: Number of units purchased.
InvoiceDate: Date and time of the transaction.
UnitPrice: Price per unit of the product.
CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer.
Country: Country where the transaction occurred.
Dataset Source: Online Retail Dataset

Methodology
Data Cleaning:

Handled missing values and removed canceled orders.
Created new features like TotalSpend.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyzed customer distribution by country, top products, and total spend.
Customer Segmentation:

Used RFM analysis to calculate Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values.
Applied K-Means clustering to group customers into segments.
Predictive Modeling:

Built a Random Forest model to predict customer churn.
Customer Lifetime Value (CLV):

Calculated CLV for each customer segment.
Key Insights
Customer Segments:

Identified key segments such as Champions, Loyal Customers, Potential Loyalists, and At Risk.
High-value segments (e.g., 551 Segment) contribute significantly to revenue.
Churn Prediction:

The Random Forest model achieved perfect accuracy (1.00) in predicting churn.
Recency and Frequency are the most important factors in predicting churn.
Customer Lifetime Value (CLV):

The 551 Segment has the highest CLV ($1,765,910), making it the most valuable customer group.
Actionable Recommendations:

Proposed targeted marketing strategies for each segment to improve engagement and retention.
